    Function that reads in a list of words and adds them to the `game_data`. Then,
    picks a random word to set as the 'solution' key in the `game_data` dictionary.
    
    Args:
      * file_path (`str`): The file to be read in
      * num_letters (`int`): The number of letters in the target solution.

    Returns:
      * `None`, updates the value of `game_data['word_list']` and `game_data['solution']`

def generate_hint(guess, solution):
    '''
    Generates a hint from a guess and a solution.

    This should be the same as the one from the Tutorial. A hint string will
    be however many letters long the guess and solution are, where each
    character represents the "correctness" of the guess:
      1. ðŸŸ© for correct letters
      2. ðŸŸ¨ for partially correct letters
      3. â¬œ for incorrect letters

    Args:
      * guess (`str`): The guess to be evaluated
      * solution (`str`): The solution to be compared to

    Returns:
      * `hint` (`str`): The hint for the user

    # letter in our guess by comparing it to our solutions. Then return the hint.

def finalize_guess(guess, hint):
    '''
    Finalizes a valid user guess.

    This function does a few things:
      1. It saves the current guess as a past guess
      2. It clears out the current guess
      3. It checks to see if the guess matches the solution
      4. It checks to see if the user has reached the max number of guesses

    Args:
      * guess (`str`): The guess to be showed on the screen.
      * hint (`str`): The evaluated hint so that we can color the blocks correctly.

    Returns:
      * `None`, instead appends a guess to `game_data['past_guesses']` and checks to see if the game is over.
