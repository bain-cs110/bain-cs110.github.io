def generate_hint(guess, solution):
    '''
    Generates a hint from a guess and a solution.

    This should be the same as the one from the Tutorial. A hint string will
    be 5 letters long, where each character represents the "correctness" of the
    guess:
      1. ðŸŸ© for correct letters
      2. ðŸŸ¨ for partially correct letters
      3. â¬œ for incorrect letters

    Args:
        guess (`str`): The guess to be evaluated
        solution (`str`): The solution to be compared to

    Returns:
        hint (`str`): The hint for the user
    '''

    # Loop through each letter of the entry and build a hint for each
    # letter in our guess by comparing it to our solutions. Then return the hint.

    for i in range(0, 5):
        # TODO: If that letter matches the corresponding one in the solution
        # then add a ðŸŸ© to our hint (hint += "ðŸŸ©")
        # Here's an example of comparing specific letters
        print(guess[i] == solution[i])

        # TODO: Else-if that letter is IN that word anywhere,
        # then add a ðŸŸ¨ to our hint (use the `in` operator!)
